    <h1>To Someone Special</h1>
    <p>
      How are you? I hope you're doing well. Today, I want to tell you something from my heart—
      I’m always with you, and I will always try to be by your side. You may not realize it, but
      my thoughts are always with you. I can never forget you, because you hold a special place in my heart.
      I’ll always try to be someone close to you, because even if distance is possible, staying away from you isn’t for me.
      Maybe I don’t mean much in your life, but I’ll never stop trying—to be there for you, to be part of your happiness
      and pain, even if silently.
